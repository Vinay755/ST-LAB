Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the
triangle problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are
supposed to be the three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values
represent an equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they
do not form a triangle at all. Derive test cases for your program based on
decision-table approach, execute the test cases and discuss the results.


ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Input a, b & c i.e. three integer values which represent three sides of
the triangle.
Step 2: if (a < (b + c)) and (b < (a + c)) and (c < (a + b) then
do step 3
else
print not a triangle. do step 6.
Step 3: if (a=b) and (b=c) then
Print triangle formed is equilateral. do step 6.
Step 4: if (a ≠ b) and (a ≠ c) and (b ≠ c) then
Print triangle formed is scalene. do step 6.
Step 5: Print triangle formed is Isosceles.
Step 6: stop

int a, b, c;

printf("Enter three sides of the triangle");
scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
if((a<b+c)&&(b<a+c)&&(c<a+b))
{
if((a==b)&&(b==c))
{
printf("Equilateral triangle");
}
else if((a!=b)&&(a!=c)&&(b!=c))
{
printf("Scalene triangle");
}

TEST CASE 1 :
Enter three sides of the triangle: 10 10 10
Equilateral triangle

TEST CASE 2 :
Enter three sides of the triangle:  5 5 2
Isosceles triangle

TEST CASE 3 :
Enter three sides of the triangle: 10 9 5
Scalene triangle

TEST CASE 4 :
Enter three sides of the triangle: 10 5 5   Triangle cannot be formed
