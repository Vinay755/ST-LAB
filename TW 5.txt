Design, develop, code and run the program in any suitable language to 
solve the commission problem. Analyze it from the perspective of decision 
table-based testing, derive different test cases, execute these test cases and 
discuss the test results. 

ALGORITHM 

Step 1: Input 3 integer numbers which represents number of Locks, Stocks 
and Barrels sold. 
Step 2: compute the total sales =(Number of Locks sold *45) + (Number of 
Stocks sold *30) + (Number of Barrels sold *25) 
Step 3: if a totals sale in dollars is less than or equal to $1000 
then commission = 0.10* total Sales do step 6 
Step 4: else if total sale is less than $1800 
then commission1 = 0.10* 1000 
commission = commission1 + (0.15 * (total sales – 1000)) 
do step 6 
Step 5: else commission1 = 0.10* 1000 
commission2 = commission1 + (0.15 * 800)) 
commission = commission2 + (0.20 * (total sales – 1800)) do 
step 6 
Step 6: Print commission. 
Step 7: Stop.
