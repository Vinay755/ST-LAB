TW:- 2.  Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form a triangle at all. Assume that the upper limit for the size of any side is 10. Derive test cases for your program based on boundary-value analysis, execute the test cases and discuss the results. 

ALGORITHM: 
Step 1: Input a, b & c i.e three integer values which represent three sides of 
the triangle. 
Step 2: if (a < (b + c)) and (b < (a + c)) and (c < (a + b) then 
do step 3 
else 
print not a triangle. do step 6. 
Step 3: if (a=b) and (b=c) then 
Print triangle formed is equilateral. do step 6. 
Step 4: if (a ≠ b) and (a ≠ c) and (b ≠ c) then 
Print triangle formed is scalene. do step 6. 
Step 5: Print triangle formed is Isosceles. 
Step 6: stop

#include<process.h> 
int main() 
{ 
int a, b, c; 
clrscr(); 
printf("Enter three sides of the triangle"); 
scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c); 
 
if((a > 10) || (b > 10) || (c > 10)) 
{ 
printf("Out of range"); 
getch(); 
exit(0); 
} 
if((a<b+c)&&(b<a+c)&&(c<a+b)) 
{ 
if((a==b)&&(b==c)) 
{ 
printf("Equilateral triangle"); 
} 
else if((a!=b)&&(a!=c)&&(b!=c)) 
{ 
printf("Scalene triangle"); 
} 
else 
printf("Isosceles triangle"); 
}

{ 
printf("triangle cannot be formed"); 
}

return 0; 
}

TEST CASE 1:
   Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   0  11  5
    a=0  b=11  c=5
    The value of a=0 is below the range
     The value of b=11 is above range

TEST CASE 2 :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   8  8  8
    a=8  b=8  c=8
    It is an Equilateral Triangle

TEST CASE 3 :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   5 5 2
    a=5  b=5  c=2
   It is an Isosceles Triangle

TEST CASE 4  :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   10 9 5
    a=10  b=9  c=5
    It is an Scalene Triangle

TEST CASE 5  :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   10 5 5 
    a=10  b=5  c=5
    Not a Triangle
