TW:- 2.  Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form a triangle at all. Assume that the upper limit for the size of any side is 10. Derive test cases for your program based on boundary-value analysis, execute the test cases and discuss the results. 

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a,b,c,c1,c2,c3,b1,b2,b3;
  do
{
printf("\n\n\nEnter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)\n");
 scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c);
 printf("\na=%d\tb=%d\tc=%d",a,b,c);
 c1 = a<=10;
 c2= b<=10;
 c3= c<=10;

 b1 = a<1;
 b2 = b<1;
 b3 = c<1;

if
    (b1)
 printf("\nThe value of a=%d is below the range",a);
 if (b2)
 printf("\nThe value of b=%d is below the range",b);
 if (b3)
 printf("\nThe value of c=%d is below the range",c);

 if (!c1)
 printf("\nThe value of a=%d is above the range",a);
 if (!c2)
 printf("\nThe value of b=%d is above the range",b);
 if (!c3)
 printf("\nThe value of c=%d is above the range",c);


} while(!(c1 && c2 && c3) && !(b1 && b2 && b3));

    if(((a+b)>c)&&((b+c)>a)&&((c+a)>b))
    {

      if((a==b)&&(b==c))
          printf("\nIt is an Equilateral Triangle");
    else if((a==b)||(b==c)||(c==a))
        printf("\nIt is an isosceles Triangle");
          else
              printf("\nIt is a Scalene Triangle");

    }
    else
    printf("\nNot a triangle");
  return 0;
}

TEST CASE 1:
   Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   0  11  5
    a=0  b=11  c=5
    The value of a=0 is below the range
     The value of b=11 is above range

TEST CASE 2 :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   8  8  8
    a=8  b=8  c=8
    It is an Equilateral Triangle

TEST CASE 3 :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   5 5 2
    a=5  b=5  c=2
   It is an Isosceles Triangle

TEST CASE 4  :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   10 9 5
    a=10  b=9  c=5
    It is an Scalene Triangle

TEST CASE 5  :
Enter 3 integers which are sides of triangle (Range 1-10)
   10 5 5 
    a=10  b=5  c=5
    Not a Triangle
